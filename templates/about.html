                            The aim of this website is to provide a comprehensive and searchable database for PhD opportunities in the UK.

                            In the UK, you can apply for 2 kinds of PhD programme.
                            Firstly, you can come up with your own project, then apply for external funding
                            from a regional body, or special fund. Unfortunately, not a lot of students get funding this way.
                            Secondly, you can apply for a ‚Äòstudentship‚Äô, where a professor has proposed and
                            (should have) funded a project. The problem is, not all of these projects are funded,
                            and if you are trying to transition between subject area, it‚Äôs difficult to know where to look.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Right now, <a href="https://findaphd.com">findaphd</a> is the most comprehensive site to find
                            these PhD studentships.
                            Unfortunately, many of these are unfunded, and there‚Äôs no way to view PhD projects without multiple
                            ads or selecting a specific subject area first. Maybe you‚Äôve done a BA in Economics, so you‚Äôre
                            looking for PhDs in that area. However, your dream project is actually in the Agriculture
                            department, but you‚Äôre never going to find it because you aren‚Äôt going to click on the
                            Agriculture page of the site.

                            We want to raise awareness of the cool projects on offer at so many
                            fantastic institutions, which all pay the UK <a href="https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/developing-people-and-skills/find-studentships-and-doctoral-training/changes-to-the-minimum-stipend-from-1-october-2023/">PhD stipend</a>,
                            and almost always pay all of your tuition fees (the caveat is that some institutions cap the number
                            of international students whose fees they cover, but this information will always be listed in the
                            PhD advertisement).

                            PhFree simplifies this journey, by returning search results linked to keywords in the
                            titles of PhD projects. We are ad-free and our data is constantly updated through the
                            findaphd database. The difference is, we remove any PhDs that aren‚Äôt funded, because <u>you deserve
                                to be paid for your research</u>.

                            UK PhD <i>projects</i> are structured differently to the US. We don't do coursework, although
                            you are usually welcome to sit in on classes (not for credit) during your PhD studies.
                            UK PhDs tend to last 3 to 4 years, so they're much shorter than their US counterparts.
                            You dive
                            straight into exploring a PhD project which has been created and advertised by a supervisory
                            team. These are the ones we have compiled on PhFree. Of course, you still shape your research,
                            but you enter your PhD programme with a more defined scope for this.

                            Oh yeah, that's our bad. In the UK, you finish your final two years of high school (called 6th Form or college),
                            then go on to university (if you want to)! You can get a BA (same thing) or BSc (BS in the US) in 3 years. Then,
                            if you want to master your subject (see what we did there), you can get an MA, MSc, MPhil (Master of Philosophy),
                            MRes (Master of Research), MSt (Master of Studies), etc, etc - you get the drill. Each university offers their
                            own thing but they're all fairly comparable. There's even super specific ones like the MEarthSci (Master of
                            Earth Sciences). Yeah. We're complicated. Sorry about that.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Then what, we hear you say? Still haven't satisfied your academic cravings? Time to get that doctorate!
                            Thankfully, the lingo goes back to normal and they're all called PhDs (except when they're DPhils at Oxford).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Still listening? Want to do a PhD in the UK? There's 2 ways of going about it. Firstly, you can get in touch
                            with a potential supervisor (UK PhDs usually require a primary and secondary supervisor, but you can figure
                            that one out down the line). You can propose your project, apply, and get an offer. The problem? You don't have
                            any funding - yet. Your options are now to secure a scholarship from your university, from an external body
                            (for US citizens, this could be something like Fulbright), or apply to a Research Council!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Research Council route is tricky yet rewarding. You have to win funding by beating out other applicants
                            in your subject area, but you're competing against entire regions. For example, there's the techne group,
                            'the craft of research in the arts and humanities', where you'd compete against students applying to any
                            one of 13 universities in the group, for arts and humanities PhDs. This is less intimidating than it sounds;
                            people at all universities get funding every year, and if you work with your supervisor to put in a strong
                            application, you have the best possible chance. This will pay for your course fees (although check if it
                            will cover all of them if you're an international student) and a living stipend for 3 to 4 years.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Secondly, if you aren't as keen about coming up with your own project, you can apply to what are called DTPs
                            (Doctoral Training Partnerships). These are organised regionally (mostly) and by subject. Bear with us as we
                            walk through an example.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Say you want to study something ~fishy~. Literally. About fish. Well, there's the
                            Centre for Doctoral Training in Sustainable Management of UK Marine Resources (handily abbreviated to CDT
                            SuMMeR)! They advertise projects relating to anything marine, which often includes fish. The projects have
                            already been funded and laid out (to an extent) by the supervisor you'd work with, so, if you apply and are
                            successful, your PhD scope is a bit more fixed - of course, there's some flexibility, but the name of the
                            project and your goals will be laid out by your supervisor, or third-party organisations who sometimes
                            put money towards these. If you're successful, you're guaranteed funding.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            These are the 2 main routes to a PhD in the UK. To make things simpler, we're only advertising the second
                            type, because, as much as we think that coming up with your own project is extremely cool, we want to draw
                            your attention to PhDs where you are <u>guaranteed</u> funding from the beginning.
